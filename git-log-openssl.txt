commit b4e6fd7b76440076eeff3a0789d40acbb5363ecf
Author: John Audia <therealgraysky@proton.me>

    openssl: update to 3.0.16
    
    Changes between 3.0.15 and 3.0.16 [11 Feb 2025]
    
    CVE-2024-13176[1] - Fixed timing side-channel in ECDSA signature
    computation.
    
    There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
    the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
    probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In
    particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this
    leak, the attacker process must either be located in the same physical
    computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency.
    
    CVE-2024-9143[2] - Fixed possible OOB memory access with invalid
    low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve parameters.
    
    Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit
    values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
    or writes. Applications working with "exotic" explicit binary (GF(2^m))
    curve parameters, that make it possible to represent invalid field
    polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs,
    may terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of
    array bounds. Remote code execution cannot easily be ruled out.

    ppp: update to 2.5.2
    
    This is a minor upgrade that mainly fixes some compilation errors
    and remove old unused code.
    
    The Makefile has been reorganized. Now all package make parameters
    are passed as configure arguments instead of environment variables.
    The compilation dependencies remain the same as ppp v2.5.1 and the
    package size changes are negligible.

    openssl: update download mirrors
    
    New releases of openssl are only published on GitHub, and official
    downloads are also redirected to GitHub. So remove the old download
    mirrors (file 404), and replace the current address with https.

    openssl: conditionally disable engine section
    
    Currently, the build option to enable/disable engine support isn't
    reflected in the final '/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf' config. It assumes `engines`
    is always enabled, producing an error whenever running any
    commands in openssl util or programs that explicitly use settings
    from '/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf'.
    
    ```
    ➤ openssl version
    FATAL: Startup failure (dev note: apps_startup()) for openssl
    307D1EA97F000000:error:12800067:lib(37):dlfcn_load:reason(103):crypto/dso/dso_dlfcn.c:118:filename(libengines.so):

    307D1EA97F000000:error:07000071:lib(14):module_run:reason(113):crypto/conf/conf_mod.c:266:module=engines
    ```
    
    Build should check for the `CONFIG_OPENSSL_ENGINE` option, and comment out `engines`
    if not explicitly enabled.
    
    Example:
    ```
    [openssl_init]
    providers = provider_sect
    ```
    
    After this change, openssl util works correctly.
    
    ```

    Major changes between OpenSSL 3.0.13 and OpenSSL 3.0.14 [04-Jun-2024]
    
    * Fixed potential use after free after SSL_free_buffers() is called.
      [CVE-2024-4741]
    * Fixed checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very slow.
      [CVE-2024-4603]
    * Fixed an issue where some non-default TLS server configurations can cause
      unbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions. An attacker may
      exploit certain server configurations to trigger unbounded memory growth that
      would lead to a Denial of Service.  [CVE-2024-2511]
    * New atexit configuration switch, which controls whether the OPENSSL_cleanup
      is registered when libcrypto is unloaded. This can be used on platforms
      where using atexit() from shared libraries causes crashes on exit

    px5g-wolfssl: Fix permission of private key
    
    Store the private key with read and write permission for the user only
    and not with read permissions for everyone. This converts the
    write_file() function from fopen() to open() because open allows to
    specify the permission mask of the newly created file. It also adds and
    fixes some existing error handling.
    
    OpenSSL does this in the same way already.
    
    With this change it looks like this:
    root@OpenWrt:/# ls -al /etc/uhttpd.*

    ramips: add support for D-Link DRA-1360
    
    The DRA-1360 rev A is a wall-plug AC1300 repeater.
    Hardware is identical (same FCC ID, black case instead of white)
    to D-Link DAP-1620 rev B, which is already supported, but a
    different model name, revision, and hardware ID are needed.
    Thus, the bulk of the DAP-1620 device tree is extracted to a
    common dtsi included by the two models' device trees.
    
    Repeating specs and installation instructions from e4c7703:
    (note that the RAM size mentioned there was incorrect, oops)
    
    Specs:
    - SoC: MT7621AT (880MHz dual-core MIPS1004Kc)
    - Memory: 128 MiB RAM, 16 MiB NOR SPI
    - WiFi: MT7615DN 2x2 802.11n + 2x2 802.11ac (DBDC)
    - Ethernet: 1 RJ45 port 10/100/1000
    - Power/status LED: red+green
    - LED RSSI bargraph: 2x green, 1x red+green
    
    Installation:
    - Keep reset button pressed during plug-in
    - Web Recovery Updater is at 192.168.0.50
      (pings are ignored, it listens only for http)
    - Upload factory.bin, confirm flashing
      (seems to work best with Chromium-based browsers)
    
    Revert to OEM firmware:
    - tail -c+117 DRA1360A1_FW112B03.bin | \
      openssl aes-256-cbc -d -md md5 -out decrypted.bin \
      -k c471706398cb147c6619f8a04a18d53e9c17ede8

    openssl: fix low-severity CVE-2023-1255
    
    This applies commit 02ac9c94 to fix this OpenSSL Security Advisory
    issued on 20th April 2023[1]:
    
    Input buffer over-read in AES-XTS implementation on 64 bit ARM
    (CVE-2023-1255)
    ==============================================================
    
    Severity: Low
    
    Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit
    ARM platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input
    buffer, leading to a crash.
    
    Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64
    bit ARM platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm
    is usually used for disk encryption.
    
    The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform
    will read past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size
    is 4 mod 5 in 16 byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the
    memory after the ciphertext buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a
    crash which results in a denial of service.
    
    If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext
    buffer being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM,
    the application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue a
    Low severity one.

    openssl: fix CVE-2023-464 and CVE-2023-465
    
    Apply two patches fixing low-severity vulnerabilities related to
    certificate policies validation:
    
    - Excessive Resource Usage Verifying X.509 Policy Constraints
      (CVE-2023-0464)
      Severity: Low
      A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions
      of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains
      that include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit
      this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that
      triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a
      denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems.
      Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
      the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
      `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.
    
    - Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored
      (CVE-2023-0465)
      Severity: Low
      Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates
      may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent
      certain checks.
      Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored
      by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that
      certificate.  A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert
      invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent policy checking on
      the certificate altogether.
      Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
      the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
      `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.
    
    Note: OpenSSL also released a fix for low-severity security advisory
    CVE-2023-466.  It is not included here because the fix only changes the
    documentation, which is not built nor included in any OpenWrt package.
    
    Due to the low-severity of these issues, there will be not be an
    immediate new release of OpenSSL.

    openssl: add legacy provider
    
    This adapts the engine build infrastructure to allow building providers,
    and packages the legacy provider.  Providers are the successors of
    engines, which have been deprecated.
    
    The legacy provider supplies OpenSSL implementations of algorithms that
    have been deemed legacy, including DES, IDEA, MDC2, SEED, and Whirlpool.
    
    Even though these algorithms are implemented in a separate package,
    their removal makes the regular library smaller by 3%, so the build
    options will remain to allow lean custom builds.  Their defaults will
    change to 'y' if not bulding for a small flash, so that the regular
    legacy package will contain a complete set of algorithms.
    
    The engine build and configuration structure was changed to accomodate
    providers, and adapt to the new style of openssl.cnf in version 3.0.
    
    There is not a clean upgrade path for the /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf file,
    installed by the openssl-conf package.  It is recommended to rename or
    remove the old config file when flashing an image with the updated
    openssl-conf package, then apply the changes manually.
    
    An old openssl.cnf file will silently work, but new engine or provider
    packages will not be enabled.  Any remaining engine config files under
    /etc/ssl/engines.cnf.d can be removed.
    
    On the build side, the include file used by engine packages was renamed
    to openssl-module.mk, so the engine packages in other feeds need to
    adapt.

    openssl: make UCI config aware of built-in engines
    
    Engines that are built into the main libcrypto OpenSSL library can't be
    disabled through UCI.  Add a 'builtin' setting to signal that the engine
    can't be disabled through UCI, and show a message explaining this in
    case buitin=1 and enabled=0.

    openssl: avoid OPENSSL_SMALL_FOOTPRINT, no-asm
    
    Building openssl with OPENSSL_SMALL_FOOTPRINT yelds only from 1% to 3%
    decrease in size, dropping performance from 2% to 91%, depending on the
    target and algorithm.
    
    For example, using AES256-GCM with 1456-bytes operations, X86_64 appears
    to be the least affected with 2% performance penalty and 1% reduction in
    size; mips drops performance by 13%, size by 3%;  Arm drops 29% in
    performance, 2% in size.
    
    On aarch64, it slows down ghash so much that I consider it broken
    (-91%).  SMALL_FOOTPRINT will reduce AES256-GCM performance by 88%, and
    size by only 1%.  It makes an AES-capable CPU run AES128-GCM at 35% of
    the speed of Chacha20-Poly1305:
    
    Block-size=1456 bytes   AES256-GCM   AES128-GCM  ChaCha20-Poly1305
    SMALL_FOOTPRINT           62014.44     65063.23          177090.50
    regular                  504220.08    565630.28          182706.16
    
    OpenSSL 1.1.1 numbers are about the same, so this should have been
    noticed a long time ago.
    
    This creates an option to use OPENSSL_SMALL_FOOTPRINT, but it is turned
    off by default unless SMALL_FLASH or LOW_MEMORY_FOOTPRINT is used.
    
    Compiling with -O3 instead of -Os, for comparison, will increase size by
    about 14-15%, with no measureable effect on AES256-GCM performance, and
    about 2% increase in Chacha20-Poly1305 performance on Aarch64.
    
    There are no Arm devices with the small flash feature, so drop the
    conditional default.  The package is built on phase2, so even if we
    include an Arm device with small flash later, a no-asm library would
    have to be built from source anyway.

    Fix the trivial abscence of $() when assigning engine config files to
    the main libopenssl-config package even if the corresponding engines
    were not built into the main library.
    
    This is mostly cosmetic, since scripts/ipkg-build tests the file's

    openssl: fix sysupgrade failure with devcrypto
    
    The bump to 3.0.8 inadvertently removed patches that are needed here,
    but were not adopted upstream.  The most important one changes the
    default value of the DIGESTS setting from ALL to NONE.  The absence of
    this patch causes a sysupgrade failure while the engine is in use with
    digests enabled.  When this happens, the system fails to boot with a
    kernel panic.
    
    Also, explicitly set DIGESTS to NONE in the provided config file, and
    change the default ciphers setting to disable ECB, which has been
    recommended for a long time and may cause trouble with some apps.
    
    The config file change by itself is not enough because the config file
    may be preserved during sysupgrade.
    
    For people affected by this bug:
    
    You can either:
    1. remove, the libopenssl-devcrypto package
    2. disable the engine in /etc/config/openssl;
    3. change /etc/ssl/engines.cnf.d/devcrypto.cnf to set DIGESTS=NONE;
    4. update libopenssl-devcrypto to >=3.0.8-3
    
    However, after doing any of the above, **you must reboot the device
    before running sysupgrade** to ensure no running application is using
    the engine.  Running `/etc/init.d/openssl restart` is not enough.

    openssl: bump to 1.1.1t
    
    Removed upstreamed patch: 010-padlock.patch
    
    Changes between 1.1.1s and 1.1.1t [7 Feb 2023]
    
      *) Fixed X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GeneralName.
    
         There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
         inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING
         but subsequently interpreted by GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE. This
         vulnerability may allow an attacker who can provide a certificate chain and
         CRL (neither of which need have a valid signature) to pass arbitrary
         pointers to a memcmp call, creating a possible read primitive, subject to
         some constraints. Refer to the advisory for more information. Thanks to
         David Benjamin for discovering this issue. (CVE-2023-0286)
    
         This issue has been fixed by changing the public header file definition of
         GENERAL_NAME so that x400Address reflects the implementation. It was not
         possible for any existing application to successfully use the existing
         definition; however, if any application references the x400Address field
         (e.g. in dead code), note that the type of this field has changed. There is
         no ABI change.
         [Hugo Landau]
    
      *) Fixed Use-after-free following BIO_new_NDEF.
    
         The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for
         streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL
         to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also
         be called directly by end user applications.
    
         The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1
         filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns
         the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions,
         for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO
         is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure.
         However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the
         BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously
         freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO
         then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.
         (CVE-2023-0215)
         [Viktor Dukhovni, Matt Caswell]
    
      *) Fixed Double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex.
    
         The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
         decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload
         data. If the function succeeds then the "name_out", "header" and "data"
         arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant
         decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is
         possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data.
         In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate
         the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed.
         If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This
         will most likely lead to a crash.
    
         The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around
         PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.
    
         These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
         functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and
         SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL
         internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does
         not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code.
         (CVE-2022-4450)
         [Kurt Roeckx, Matt Caswell]
    
      *) Fixed Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption.
    
         A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption
         implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across
         a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
         decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number
         of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding
         modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.

    2. Rename initramfs-kernel.bin to "factory.bin" and put it in the root
       directory of the tftp server. (tftpd64 is a good choice for Windows)
    3. Start the TFTP server, plug in the power supply, and wait for the
       system to boot.
    4. Backup "firmware" partition and rename it to "firmware.bin", we need
       it to back to stock firmware.
    5. Use "fw_printenv" command to list envs.
       If "firmware_select=2" is observed then set u-boot enviroment:
       /# fw_setenv firmware_select 1
    6. Apply sysupgrade.bin in OpenWrt LuCI.
    
    Web UI Installation:
    1. Apply update by uploading initramfs-factory.bin to the web UI.
    2. Use "fw_printenv" command to list envs.
       If "firmware_select=2" is observed then set u-boot enviroment:
       /# fw_setenv firmware_select 1
    3. Apply squashfs-sysupgrade.bin in OpenWrt LuCI.
    
    Recovery to stock firmware:
    a. Upload "firmware.bin" to OpenWrt /tmp, then execute:
       /# mtd -r write /tmp/firmware.bin firmware
    b. We can also write factory image "UploadBrush-bin.img" to firmware
       partition to recovery. Upload image file to /tmp, then execute:
       /# mtd erase firmware
       /# mtd -r write /tmp/UploadBrush-bin.img firmware
    
    How to extract stock firmware image:
      Download stock firmware, then use openssl:
      openssl aes-256-cbc -d -salt -in [Downloaded_Firmware] \
      -out "firmware.tar.tgz" -k QiLunSmartWL

    openssl: bump to 1.1.1q
    
    Changes between 1.1.1p and 1.1.1q [5 Jul 2022]
    
      *) AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised
         implementation would not encrypt the entirety of the data under some
         circumstances.  This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was
         preexisting in the memory that wasn't written.  In the special case of
         "in place" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed.
    
         Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS,
         they are both unaffected.

    openssl: bump to 1.1.1p
    
    Changes between 1.1.1o and 1.1.1p [21 Jun 2022]
    
      *) In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in
         CVE-2022-1292, further bugs where the c_rehash script does not
         properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection have been
         fixed.
    
         When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there
         are other places in the script where the file names of certificates
         being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell.
    
         This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where
         it is automatically executed.  On such operating systems, an attacker
         could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.
    
         Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced
         by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.
         (CVE-2022-2068)
         [Daniel Fiala, Tomáš Mráz]
    
      *) When OpenSSL TLS client is connecting without any supported elliptic
         curves and TLS-1.3 protocol is disabled the connection will no longer fail
         if a ciphersuite that does not use a key exchange based on elliptic
         curves can be negotiated.

    This reverts commit 35d2bbc29ba7f802706bf65585aeb8808fcac622 as we
    believe we found that it is indeed an openssl issue, where openssl is
    trying to use getrandom(2), but fails because this particular builder
    has an ancient kernel without that syscall. We didn't get to the bottom

    openssl: move engine.mk to INCLUDE_DIR
    
    engine.mk is supposed to be included by engine packages, but it will not
    be present in the SDK in the same place as in the main repository.
    
    Move it to include/openssl-engine.mk to avoid this.

    openssl: configure engines with uci
    
    This uses uci to configure engines, by generating a list of enabled
    engines in /var/etc/ssl/engines.cnf from engines configured in
    /etc/config/openssl:
    
        config engine 'devcrypto'
                option enabled '1'
    
    Currently the only options implemented are 'enabled', which defaults to
    true and enables the named engine, and the 'force' option, that enables
    the engine even if the init script thinks the engine does not exist.
    
    The existence test is to check for either a configuration file
    /etc/ssl/engines.cnf.d/%ENGINE%.cnf, or a shared object file
    /usr/lib/engines-1.1/%ENGINE%.so.
    
    The engine list is generated by an init script which is set to run after
    'log' because it informs the engines being enabled or skipped.  It
    should run before any service using OpenSSL as the crypto library,
    otherwise the service will not use any engine.

    This enables an engine during its package's installation, by adding it

    The engine build system was reworked, with the addition of an engine.mk

    used by out of tree engines as well.

    tfa-layerscape: fix build on systems without openssl headers
    
    The build fails when the openssl/sha.h header file is not installed on
    the host system. Fix this by setting the HOSTCCFLAGS variable to the
    OpenWrt HOST_CFLAGS variable, without setting this the include paths and
    other modifications in the host flags done by OpenWrt will be ignored by
    the build.
    
    This fixes the following build problem:
    gcc -c -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=700 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=c99 -O2 -I../../include/tools_share fiptool.c -o fiptool.o

    openssl: add ppc64 support
    
    Backport an upstream patch that adds support for ELFv2 ABI on big endian
    ppc64. As musl only supports ELFv2 ABI on ppc64 regardless of
    endianness, this is required to be able to build OpenSSL for ppc64be.
    
    Modify our targets patch to add linux-powerpc64-openwrt, which will use
    the linux64v2 perlasm scheme. This will probably break the combination
    ppc64 with glibc, but as we really only want to support musl, this
    shouldn't be a problem.

    wolfssl: build with WOLFSSL_ALT_CERT_CHAINS
    
    "Alternate certification chains, as oppossed to requiring full chain
    validataion. Certificate validation behavior is relaxed, similar to
    openssl and browsers. Only the peer certificate must validate to a trusted
    certificate. Without this, all certificates sent by a peer must be
    used in the trust chain or the connection will be rejected."
    
    This fixes e.g. uclient-fetch and curl connecting to servers using a Let's
    Encrypt certificate which are cross-signed by the now expired
    DST Root CA X3, see [0].
    
    This is the recommended solution from upstream [1].

    treewide: unmark selected packages nonshared
    
    This partially reverts changes done in commit 72cc44958ef4 ("treewide:
    mark selected packages nonshared") as it removes the nonshared flag, but
    keeps the PKG_RELEASE as the PKG_RELEASE bump while adding nonshared
    flag was incorrect.
    
    Unmark uci, ubus, libubox, lua, libnl-tiny and libjson-c as nonshared
    packages as this fix attempt didn't worked out. Currently the
    imagebuilder is broken again:
    
     openwrt-imagebuilder-21.02.0-rc3-ipq40xx-generic.Linux-x86_64$ make image PROFILE=avm_fritzbox-7530 PACKAGES=luci-ssl-openssl
     ...
     Collected errors:
      * pkg_hash_check_unresolved: cannot find dependency libiwinfo20210430 for luci-mod-status
      * pkg_hash_fetch_best_installation_candidate: Packages for luci-mod-status found, but incompatible with the architectures configured
      * pkg_hash_check_unresolved: cannot find dependency libiwinfo20210430 for rpcd-mod-iwinfo
      * pkg_hash_fetch_best_installation_candidate: Packages for rpcd-mod-iwinfo found, but incompatible with the architectures configured
      * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for luci-ssl-openssl:
      *     libiwinfo20210430
      * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package luci-ssl-openssl.
    
    Everything because iwinfo's ABI was changed two times since rc3 release:
    
     +IWINFO_ABI_VERSION:=20210430
     +IWINFO_ABI_VERSION:=20210420
    
    Since iwinfo is marked as nonshared, it wasn't built by phase2 builders, but
    luci-mod-status was already updated 2 times since rc3 and was thus rebuilt by
    phase2 builders:
    
     d1d452ed2fb3 luci-mod-status: don't set '-' hostname when creating static lease
     95b3633055c1 luci-mod-status: switch to html table for wlan channel analysis
    
    So now luci-mod-status depends on libiwinfo20210430 but only
    libiwinfo20210106 can be downloaded. This is first part of the fix, in
    the upcoming commit Jo is going to remove nonshared flag from iwinfo
    package as well.

    mvebu: armada 370: dts: fix the crypto engine
    
    The crypto engine in Armada 370 SoCs is currently broken. It can be
    checked installing the required packages for testing openssl with hw
    acceleration:
    
      opkg install openssl-util
      opkg install kmod-cryptodev
      opkg install libopenssl-devcrypto
    
    After configuring /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf to let openssl use the crypto
    engine for digest operations, and performing some checksums..
    
      md5sum 10M-file.bin
      openssl md5 10M-file.bin
    
    ...we can see they don't match.
    
    There might be an alignment or size constraint issue caused by the
    idle-sram area.
    
    Use the whole crypto sram and disable the idle-sram area to fix it. Also
    disable the idle support by adding the broken-idle property to prevent
    accessing the disabled idle-sram.
    
    We don't care about disabling the idle support since it is already broken
    in Armada 370 causing a huge performance loss because it disables
    permanently the L2 cache. This was reported in the Openwrt forum and
    elsewhere by Debian users with different board models.

    Simplify cmake option handling by putting everything in blocks.
    
    Add openssl patch as there's no easy way to disable.
    
    Rebase the skip manpages patch.
    
    Remove the monitor mode patch as it no longer applies.
    
    Remove flex patch as normal Makefile is no longer used.
    
    Remove USB path patch. While it is deprecated, the codepath is never
    taken. /sys/bus/usb/devices is checked before hand. If it exists, the

    elsewhere in the code.

    openssl: always build with GOST engine support
    
    The packages feed has a proposed package for a GOST engine, which needs
    support from the main openssl library.  It is a default option in
    OpenSSL.  All that needs to be done here is to not disable it.
    
    Package increases by a net 1-byte, so it is not really really worth
    keeping this optional.
    
    This commit also includes a commented-out example engine configuration
    in openssl.cnf, as it is done for other available engines.

    openssl: bump to 1.1.1j
    
    This fixes 4 security vulnerabilities/bugs:
    
    - CVE-2021-2839 - SSLv2 vulnerability. Openssl 1.1.1 does not support
      SSLv2, but the affected functions still exist. Considered just a bug.
    
    - CVE-2021-2840 - calls EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and
      EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some
      cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable
      length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value
      from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output
      length value will be negative.
    
    - CVE-2021-2841 - The X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() function attempts to
      create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data
      contained within an X509 certificate. However it was failing to
      correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer
      field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously
      constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and
      a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.
    
    - Fixed SRP_Calc_client_key so that it runs in constant time. This could
      be exploited in a side channel attack to recover the password.
    
    The 3 CVEs above are currently awaiting analysis.

    openssl: revert EOF detection change in 1.1.1
    
    This adds patches to avoid possible application breakage caused by a
    change in behavior introduced in 1.1.1e.  It affects at least nginx,
    which logs error messages such as:
    nginx[16652]: [crit] 16675#0: *358 SSL_read() failed (SSL: error:
    4095126:SSL routines:ssl3_read_n:unexpected eof while reading) while
    keepalive, client: xxxx, server: [::]:443
    
    Openssl commits db943f4 (Detect EOF while reading in libssl), and
    22623e0 (Teach more BIOs how to handle BIO_CTRL_EOF) changed the
    behavior when encountering an EOF in SSL_read().  Previous behavior was
    to return SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL, but errno would still be 0.  The commits
    being reverted changed it to SSL_ERRO_SSL, and add an error to the
    stack, which is correct.  Unfortunately this affects a number of
    applications that counted on the old behavior, including nginx.
    
    The reversion was discussed in openssl/openssl#11378, and implemented as
    PR openssl/openssl#11400.

    hostapd: Update to version 2.8 (2019-04-21)
    
    This also syncs the configuration files with the default configuration
    files, but no extra options are activated or deactivated.
    
    The mesh patches were partially merged into hostapd 2.8, the remaining
    patches were extracted from patchwork and are now applied by OpenWrt.
    The patches still have open questions which are not fixed by the author.
    They were taken from this page:
    https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/hostap/list/?series=62725&state=*
    
    The changes in 007-mesh-apply-channel-attributes-before-running-Mesh.patch
    where first applied to hostapd, but later reverted in hostapd commit
    3e949655ccc5 because they caused memory leaks.

    px5g: support EC keys
    
    This adds an 'eckey' command to generate an EC key, with an optional
    curve name argument, with P-256 as default.
    
    For the 'selfsigned' command, it adds an 'ec' algorithm argument to the
    '-newkey' option, and a '-pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:<curvename>' option,
    mirroring the way openssl specifies the curve name.
    
    Notice that curve names are not necessarily the same in mbedtls and
    openssl.  In particular, secp256r1 works for mbedtls, but openssl uses
    prime256v1 instead. px5g uses mbedtls, but short NIST curve names P-256
    and P-384 are specifically supported.
    
    Package size increased by about 900 bytes (arm).

    tfa-layerscape: fix fiptool host build
    
    fiptool is a host tool, used in a firmware generation pipeline, but it's
    not treated as such, leading to the build breakage on the hosts which
    don't have {Open,Libre}SSL dev package installed:
    
     In file included from fiptool.h:16:0,
                     from fiptool.c:19:
                     fiptool_platform.h:18:27: fatal error: openssl/sha.h:
                     No such file or directory
                      #  include <openssl/sha.h>
    
    So this patch promotes fiptool into the host tool with proper host
    include and library paths under STAGING_DIR.

    LibreSSL 2.9.1 now has a test that requires libtls.a, however, when building a
    shared library only build, the --disable-static flag is passed to libressl,
    which prevents the building of libtls.a.

    There are three options to fix this:
    1) Stick with autotools, and provide a patch that removes building anything in
       the tests folder.
    2) Pass --enable-static to LIBRESSL_CONF_OPTS
    3) Change the package type to cmake, as a cmake build does not have this issue."
    
    It appears we cannot change to cmake because cmake has a dependency on
    an ssl library.
    
    Take option 1 and do not build the tests.
    
    Also take the opportunity to remove man page building as well.

    openssl: change defaults: ENGINE:on, NPN:off, misc
    
    The sender domain has a DMARC Reject/Quarantine policy which disallows
    sending mailing list messages using the original "From" header.
    
    To mitigate this problem, the original message has been wrapped
    automatically by the mailing list software.
    Enable engine support by default.  Right now, some packages require
    this, so it is always enabled by the bots.  Many packages will compile
    differently when engine support is detected, needing engine symbols from
    the libraries.
    
    However, being off by default, a user compiling its own image will fail
    to run some popular packages from the official repo.
    Note that disabling engines did not work in 1.0.2, so this problem never
    showed up before.
    
    NPN support has been removed in major browsers & servers, and has become
    a small bloat, so it does not make sense to leave it on by default.
    
    Remove deprecated CONFIG_ENGINE_CRYPTO symbol that is no longer needed.

    hostapd: fix CVE-2019-9497, CVE-2019-9498, CVE-2019-9499
    
    EAP-pwd missing commit validation
    
    Published: April 10, 2019
    Identifiers:
    - CVE-2019-9497 (EAP-pwd server not checking for reflection attack)
    - CVE-2019-9498 (EAP-pwd server missing commit validation for
      scalar/element)
    - CVE-2019-9499 (EAP-pwd peer missing commit validation for
      scalar/element)
    
    Latest version available from: https://w1.fi/security/2019-4/
    
    Vulnerability
    
    EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) and wpa_supplicant (EAP
    peer) was discovered not to validate the received scalar and element
    values in EAP-pwd-Commit messages properly. This could result in attacks
    that would be able to complete EAP-pwd authentication exchange without
    the attacker having to know the used password.
    
    A reflection attack is possible against the EAP-pwd server since the
    hostapd EAP server did not verify that the EAP-pwd-Commit contains
    scalar/element values that differ from the ones the server sent out
    itself. This allows the attacker to complete EAP-pwd authentication
    without knowing the password, but this does not result in the attacker
    being able to derive the session key (MSK), i.e., the attacker would not
    be able to complete the following key exchange (e.g., 4-way handshake in
    RSN/WPA).
    
    An attack using invalid scalar/element values is possible against both
    the EAP-pwd server and peer since hostapd and wpa_supplicant did not
    validate these values in the received EAP-pwd-Commit messages. If the
    used crypto library does not implement additional checks for the element
    (EC point), this could result in attacks where the attacker could use a
    specially crafted commit message values to manipulate the exchange to
    result in deriving a session key value from a very small set of possible
    values. This could further be used to attack the EAP-pwd server in a
    practical manner. An attack against the EAP-pwd peer is slightly more
    complex, but still consider practical. These invalid scalar/element
    attacks could result in the attacker being able to complete
    authentication and learn the session key and MSK to allow the key
    exchange to be completed as well, i.e., the attacker gaining access to
    the network in case of the attack against the EAP server or the attacker
    being able to operate a rogue AP in case of the attack against the EAP
    peer.
    
    While similar attacks might be applicable against SAE, it should be
    noted that the SAE implementation in hostapd and wpa_supplicant does
    have the validation steps that were missing from the EAP-pwd
    implementation and as such, these attacks do not apply to the current
    SAE implementation. Old versions of wpa_supplicant/hostapd did not
    include the reflection attack check in the SAE implementation, though,
    since that was added in June 2015 for v2.5 (commit 6a58444d27fd 'SAE:
    Verify that own/peer commit-scalar and COMMIT-ELEMENT are different').
    
    Vulnerable versions/configurations
    
    All hostapd versions with EAP-pwd support (CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build
    configuration and EAP-pwd being enabled in the runtime configuration)
    are vulnerable against the reflection attack.
    
    All wpa_supplicant and hostapd versions with EAP-pwd support
    (CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration and EAP-pwd being enabled
    in the runtime configuration) are vulnerable against the invalid
    scalar/element attack when built against a crypto library that does not
    have an explicit validation step on imported EC points. The following
    list indicates which cases are vulnerable/not vulnerable:
    - OpenSSL v1.0.2 or older: vulnerable
    - OpenSSL v1.1.0 or newer: not vulnerable
    - BoringSSL with commit 38feb990a183 ('Require that EC points are on the
      curve.') from September 2015: not vulnerable
    - BoringSSL without commit 38feb990a183: vulnerable
    - LibreSSL: vulnerable
    - wolfssl: vulnerable
    
    Acknowledgments
    
    Thanks to Mathy Vanhoef (New York University Abu Dhabi) for discovering
    and reporting the issues and for proposing changes to address them in
    the implementation.
    
    Possible mitigation steps

    hostapd: fix CVE-2019-9495
    
    EAP-pwd side-channel attack
    
    Published: April 10, 2019
    Identifiers:
    - CVE-2019-9495 (cache attack against EAP-pwd)
    Latest version available from: https://w1.fi/security/2019-2/
    
    Vulnerability
    
    Number of potential side channel attacks were recently discovered in the
    SAE implementations used by both hostapd and wpa_supplicant (see
    security advisory 2019-1 and VU#871675). EAP-pwd uses a similar design
    for deriving PWE from the password and while a specific attack against
    EAP-pwd is not yet known to be tested, there is no reason to believe
    that the EAP-pwd implementation would be immune against the type of
    cache attack that was identified for the SAE implementation. Since the
    EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) and wpa_supplicant (EAP
    peer) does not support MODP groups, the timing attack described against
    SAE is not applicable for the EAP-pwd implementation.
    
    A novel cache-based attack against SAE handshake would likely be
    applicable against the EAP-pwd implementation. Even though the
    wpa_supplicant/hostapd PWE derivation iteration for EAP-pwd has
    protections against timing attacks, this new cache-based attack might
    enable an attacker to determine which code branch is taken in the
    iteration if the attacker is able to run unprivileged code on the victim
    machine (e.g., an app installed on a smart phone or potentially a
    JavaScript code on a web site loaded by a web browser). This depends on
    the used CPU not providing sufficient protection to prevent unprivileged
    applications from observing memory access patterns through the shared
    cache (which is the most likely case with today's designs).
    
    The attacker could use information about the selected branch to learn
    information about the password and combine this information from number
    of handshake instances with an offline dictionary attack. With
    sufficient number of handshakes and sufficiently weak password, this
    might result in full recovery of the used password if that password is
    not strong enough to protect against dictionary attacks.
    
    This attack requires the attacker to be able to run a program on the
    target device. This is not commonly the case on an authentication server
    (EAP server), so the most likely target for this would be a client
    device using EAP-pwd.
    
    The commits listed in the end of this advisory change the EAP-pwd
    implementation shared by hostapd and wpa_supplicant to perform the PWE
    derivation loop using operations that use constant time and memory
    access pattern to minimize the externally observable differences from
    operations that depend on the password even for the case where the
    attacker might be able to run unprivileged code on the same device.
    
    Vulnerable versions/configurations
    
    All wpa_supplicant and hostapd versions with EAP-pwd support
    (CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration and EAP-pwd being enabled
    in the runtime configuration).
    
    It should also be noted that older versions of wpa_supplicant/hostapd
    prior to v2.7 did not include additional protection against certain
    timing differences. The definition of the EAP-pwd (RFC 5931) does not
    describe such protection, but the same issue that was addressed in SAE
    earlier can be applicable against EAP-pwd as well and as such, that
    implementation specific extra protection (commit 22ac3dfebf7b, "EAP-pwd:
    Mask timing of PWE derivation") is needed to avoid showing externally
    visible timing differences that could leak information about the
    password. Any uses of older wpa_supplicant/hostapd versions with EAP-pwd
    are recommended to update to v2.7 or newer in addition to the mitigation
    steps listed below for the more recently discovered issue.
    
    Possible mitigation steps
    
    - Merge the following commits to wpa_supplicant/hostapd and rebuild:
    
      OpenSSL: Use constant time operations for private bignums
      Add helper functions for constant time operations
      OpenSSL: Use constant time selection for crypto_bignum_legendre()
      EAP-pwd: Use constant time and memory access for finding the PWE
    
      These patches are available from https://w1.fi/security/2019-2/
    
    - Update to wpa_supplicant/hostapd v2.8 or newer, once available
    
    - Use strong passwords to prevent dictionary attacks

    hostapd: fix CVE-2019-9494
    
    SAE side-channel attacks
    
    Published: April 10, 2019
    Identifiers:
    - VU#871675
    - CVE-2019-9494 (cache attack against SAE)
    Latest version available from: https://w1.fi/security/2019-1/
    
    Vulnerability
    
    Number of potential side channel attacks were discovered in the SAE
    implementations used by both hostapd (AP) and wpa_supplicant
    (infrastructure BSS station/mesh station). SAE (Simultaneous
    Authentication of Equals) is also known as WPA3-Personal. The discovered
    side channel attacks may be able to leak information about the used
    password based on observable timing differences and cache access
    patterns. This might result in full password recovery when combined with
    an offline dictionary attack and if the password is not strong enough to
    protect against dictionary attacks.
    
    Cache attack
    
    A novel cache-based attack against SAE handshake was discovered. This
    attack targets SAE with ECC groups. ECC group 19 being the mandatory
    group to support and the most likely used group for SAE today, so this
    attack applies to the most common SAE use case. Even though the PWE
    derivation iteration in SAE has protections against timing attacks, this
    new cache-based attack enables an attacker to determine which code
    branch is taken in the iteration if the attacker is able to run
    unprivileged code on the victim machine (e.g., an app installed on a
    smart phone or potentially a JavaScript code on a web site loaded by a
    web browser). This depends on the used CPU not providing sufficient
    protection to prevent unprivileged applications from observing memory
    access patterns through the shared cache (which is the most likely case
    with today's designs).
    
    The attacker can use information about the selected branch to learn
    information about the password and combine this information from number
    of handshake instances with an offline dictionary attack. With
    sufficient number of handshakes and sufficiently weak password, this
    might result in full discovery of the used password.
    
    This attack requires the attacker to be able to run a program on the
    target device. This is not commonly the case on access points, so the
    most likely target for this would be a client device using SAE in an
    infrastructure BSS or mesh BSS.
    
    The commits listed in the end of this advisory change the SAE
    implementation shared by hostapd and wpa_supplicant to perform the PWE
    derivation loop using operations that use constant time and memory
    access pattern to minimize the externally observable differences from
    operations that depend on the password even for the case where the
    attacker might be able to run unprivileged code on the same device.
    
    Timing attack
    
    The timing attack applies to the MODP groups 22, 23, and 24 where the
    PWE generation algorithm defined for SAE can have sufficient timing
    differences for an attacker to be able to determine how many rounds were
    needed to find the PWE based on the used password and MAC
    addresses. When the attack is repeated with multiple times, the attacker
    may be able to gather enough information about the password to be able
    to recover it fully using an offline dictionary attack if the password
    is not strong enough to protect against dictionary attacks. This attack
    could be performed by an attacker in radio range of an access point or a
    station enabling the specific MODP groups.
    
    This timing attack requires the applicable MODP groups to be enabled
    explicitly in hostapd/wpa_supplicant configuration (sae_groups
    parameter). All versions of hostapd/wpa_supplicant have disabled these
    groups by default.
    
    While this security advisory lists couple of commits introducing
    additional protection for MODP groups in SAE, it should be noted that
    the groups 22, 23, and 24 are not considered strong enough to meet the
    current expectation for a secure system. As such, their use is
    discouraged even if the additional protection mechanisms in the
    implementation are included.
    
    Vulnerable versions/configurations
    
    All wpa_supplicant and hostapd versions with SAE support (CONFIG_SAE=y
    in the build configuration and SAE being enabled in the runtime
    configuration).
    
    Acknowledgments
    
    Thanks to Mathy Vanhoef (New York University Abu Dhabi) and Eyal Ronen
    (Tel Aviv University) for discovering the issues and for discussions on
    how to address them.
    
    Possible mitigation steps
    
    - Merge the following commits to wpa_supplicant/hostapd and rebuild:
    
      OpenSSL: Use constant time operations for private bignums
      Add helper functions for constant time operations
      OpenSSL: Use constant time selection for crypto_bignum_legendre()
      SAE: Minimize timing differences in PWE derivation
      SAE: Avoid branches in is_quadratic_residue_blind()
      SAE: Mask timing of MODP groups 22, 23, 24
      SAE: Use const_time selection for PWE in FFC
      SAE: Use constant time operations in sae_test_pwd_seed_ffc()
    
      These patches are available from https://w1.fi/security/2019-1/
    
    - Update to wpa_supplicant/hostapd v2.8 or newer, once available
    
    - In addition to either of the above alternatives, disable MODP groups
      1, 2, 5, 22, 23, and 24 by removing them from hostapd/wpa_supplicant
      sae_groups runtime configuration parameter, if they were explicitly
      enabled since those groups are not considered strong enough to meet
      current security expectations. The groups 22, 23, and 24 are related
      to the discovered side channel (timing) attack. The other groups in
      the list are consider too weak to provide sufficient security. Note
      that all these groups have been disabled by default in all
      hostapd/wpa_supplicant versions and these would be used only if
      explicitly enabled in the configuration.

    openssl: disable digests by default, misc fixes
    
    Openssh uses digest contexts across forks, which is not supported by the
    /dev/crypto engine.  The speed of digests is usually not worth enabling
    them anyway.  This changes the default of the DIGESTS option to NONE, so
    the user still has the option to enable them.
    
    Added another patch related to the use of encryption contexts across
    forks, that ignores a failure to close a previous open session when
    reinitializing a context, instead of failing the reinitialization.
    
    Added a link to the Cryptographic Hardware Accelerators document to the
    engine pacakges description, to provide more detailed instructions to
    configure the engines.
    
    Revert the removal of the OPENSSL_ENGINE_CRYPTO symbol, currently used
    by openssh.  There is an open PR to update openssh; when merged, this
    symbol can be safely removed.

    openssl: optimizations based on ARCH/small flash
    
    Add a patch to enable the option to change the default ciphersuite list
    ordering to prefer ChaCha20 over AES-GCM.  This is used by default for
    all platforms, except for x86_64 and aarch64. The assumption is that
    only the latter have AES-specific CPU instructions and asm code that
    uses them in openssl.  Chacha20Poly1305 is 3x faster than AES-256 in
    systems without AES instructions, with an equivalent strength.
    
    Disable error messages by default except for devices with small flash or
    RAM, to aid debugging.
    
    Disable ASM by default on arm platform with small flash.  Size
    difference on mips and powerpc, the other platforms with small flash
    devices, are not really relevant (using 100K as a threshold).  All of
    the affected platforms are source-only anyway.

commit e6bcf1e4acc4901c1803cdccc4b9fabfd6d84c90
Author: Jo-Philipp Wich <jo@mein.io>

    build: add ABI_VERSION to binary package names
    
    Add the ABI_VERSION source makefile variable to the binary package basename
    and resolve source dependencies on packages with ABI_VERSION set to such
    expanded names.
    
    If for example a package specifies DEPENDS:=libopenssl while the OpenSSL
    Makefile specifies ABI_VERSION:=1.0.0, the resulting ipk control data
    dependency will be "Depends: libopenssl1.0.0" and the libopenssl ipk file
    will be called "libopenssl1.0.0_<version>_<arch>.ipk".
    
    The next time a library such as OpenSSL is updated to an incompatible
    version, the ABI_VERSION shall be changed accordingly to prevent opkg from
    simply upgrading to an incompatible library without considering the
    dependencies of already installed packages.
    
    Also introduce another "SourceName" control field which is required by
    the newly introduced "scritps/ipkg-remove" to determine the proper related
    .ipk files to delete upon buildroot package clean operations.

    cryptodev-linux: move from packages feed
    
    The sender domain has a DMARC Reject/Quarantine policy which disallows
    sending mailing list messages using the original "From" header.
    
    To mitigate this problem, the original message has been wrapped
    automatically by the mailing list software.
    This is actually a build dependency for /dev/crypto support in openssl.
    Since it is a kernel module, it belongs here anyway.

    openssl: enable OPENSSL_WITH_DEPRECATED when OpenSSL is built as a build dep
    
    Some package (e.g. libunbound) depend on OPENSSL_WITH_DEPRECATED. In some
    situations it may happen that libunbound and openssl are only pulled in as
    build dependencies, but are not enabled in .config.
    
    In such cases, the defaults of symbols like OPENSSL_WITH_DEPRECATED are
    ignored (as the whole symbol depends on PACKAGE_libopenssl), and config
    symbol dependencies of libunbound aren't effective either (as libunbound
    is not actually enabled).
    
    This commit works around the issue by introducing a hidden negated symbol
    OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED, which is always disabled when PACKAGE_libopenssl is
    disabled, and ensures that OpenSSL is built with deprecated APIs in this
    case. A user can still manage to break the build by explicitly enabling
    libopenssl and disabling OPENSSL_WITH_DEPRECATED; the interaction between
    build dependencies and config symbols will require further discussion.

    hostapd: Activate Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
    
    This build the full openssl and wolfssl versions with SAE support which
    is the main part of WPA3 PSK.
    
    This needs elliptic curve cryptography which is only provided by these
    two external cryptographic libraries and not by the internal
    implementation.
    
    The WPA3_Specification_v1.0.pdf file says that in SAE only mode
    Protected Management Frames (PMF) is required, in mixed mode with
    WPA2-PSK PMF should be required for clients using SAE, and optional for
    clients using WPA2-PSK. The defaults are set now accordingly.
    
    This increases the ipkg size by 8.515 Bytes.
    Old: 394.026 Bytes
    New: 402.541 Bytes

    curl: Use ca-bundle for all TLS libraries.
    
    It simplifies the Makefile a bit. In addition, using ca-bundle
    saves some space as well.
    
    It also fixes an issue with at least transmission, which has a dependency
    on ca-bundle, but currently libcurl with OpenSSL or GnuTLS cause it not
    to work.
    
    This has been tested on mt7621 with OpenSSL and GnuTLS just by running
    'curl https://www.google.com' and seeing if there's a verify error.
    The rest are already using ca-bundle and therefore work fine.

    uboot-mvebu: fix build ; use the build's tools/libressl
    
    Since I have no openssl-dev on my machine, I first
    get this error:
    
    ```
    tools/kwbimage.c:21:10: fatal error: openssl/bn.h: No such file or directory
     #include <openssl/bn.h>
    ```
    
    After removing the UBOOT_MAKE_FLAGS the next error is:
    ```
    tools/kwbimage.c:40:6: error: conflicting types for ‘EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup’
     void EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup(EVP_MD_CTX *ctx)
    ```
    
    After removing the OpenSSL patches the next error is:
    ```
      HOSTLD  tools/dumpimage
    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lssl
    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcrypto

    make[5]: *** [tools/dumpimage] Error 1
    
    ```
    
    So, the final part is to add the build system's

    openssl: Enable assembler optimizations for aarch64
    
    OpenSSL is built with the generic linux settings for most targets,
    including aarch64.  These generic settings are designed for 32-bit CPU and
    provide no assembler optmization: this is widely suboptimal for aarch64.
    
    This patch simply switches to the aarch64 settings that are already
    available in OpenSSL.
    
    Here is the output of "openssl speed" before the optimization, with
    "(...)" representing build flags that didn't change:
    
        OpenSSL 1.0.2l  25 May 2017
        options:bn(64,32) rc4(ptr,char) des(idx,cisc,2,int) aes(partial) blowfish(ptr)
        compiler: aarch64-openwrt-linux-musl-gcc  (...)
    
    And after this patch, OpenSSL uses 64 bit mode and assembler optimizations:
    
        OpenSSL 1.0.2l  25 May 2017
        options:bn(64,64) rc4(ptr,char) des(idx,cisc,2,int) aes(partial) blowfish(ptr)
        compiler: aarch64-openwrt-linux-musl-gcc  (...)  -DSHA1_ASM -DSHA256_ASM -DSHA512_ASM
    
    Here are some benchmarks on a pine64+ running latest LEDE master r5142-20d363aed3:

    For some reason AES and blowfish do not benefit, but SHA performance
    improves between 1.7x and 15x.  SHA256 clearly benefits the most from the
    optimization (4.5x on small blocks, 15x on large blocks!).

    Blowfish does not seem to have assembler optimization at all, and SHA
    still benefits (between 1.6x and 14.5x) but is generally slower than in
    non-EVP mode.
    
    However, AES performance is improved between 5.5x and 27.5x, which is
    really impressive!  For aes-128-cbc on large blocks, a core i7-6600U
    @2.60GHz is only twice as fast...

    hostapd: escape double quoutes in wpad CFLAGS
    
    A recent commit in hostapd added a build option to specify the default
    TLS ciphers. This build option is passed via CFLAGS. Due to the way
    CFLAGS are handled when building wpad, the compiler tries to recursively
    expand TLS_DEFAULT_CIPHERS, resulting in the following error:
    
    ../src/crypto/tls_openssl.c: In function 'tls_init':
    <command-line>:0:21: error: 'DEFAULT' undeclared (first use in this function)
    ../src/crypto/tls_openssl.c:1028:13: note: in expansion of macro 'TLS_DEFAULT_CIPHERS'
       ciphers = TLS_DEFAULT_CIPHERS;
                 ^
    
    Escape double quotes in the .cflags file to avoid this.

    libs/wolfssl: disable hardening check in `settings.h`
    
    This seems to cause a false-positive warning/error
    while building `libwebsockets-cyassl`.

                 #warning "For timing resistance / side-channel attack prevention consider using harden options"
    
    ```
    
    Hardening is enabled by default in libwolfssl at build-time.
    
    However, the `settings.h` header is exported (along with other headers)
    for build (via Build/InstallDev).
    
    This looks like a small bug/issue with wolfssl.

    Following upstream changes, /etc/easy-rsa/pki replaces
    /etc/easy-rsa/keys directory.
    
    The default /etc/easy-rsa/pki dir is marked to be kept during
    upgrade (WARN: priv keys are saved in the system backup)
    /etc/easy-rsa/openssl.1.0.cnf is now marked as config file while

    uhttpd: create self-signed certificates with unique subjects
    
    Add a partially random O= item to the certificate subject in order
    to make the automatically generated certificates' subjects unique.
    
    Firefox has problems when several self-signed certificates
    with CA:true attribute and identical subjects have been
    seen (and stored) by the browser. Reference to upstream bugs:
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1147544
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1056341
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1204670#c34
    
    Certificates created by the OpenSSL one-liner fall into that category.
    
    Avoid identical certificate subjects by including a new 'O=' item
    with CommonName + a random part (8 chars). Example:
    /CN=LEDE/O=LEDEb986be0b/L=Unknown/ST=Somewhere/C=ZZ
    
    That ensures that the browser properly sees the accumulating
    certificates as separate items and does not spend time
    trying to form a trust chain from them.

    uhttpd: support using OpenSSL for certificate generation
    
    Support the usage of the OpenSSL command-line tool for generating
    the SSL certificate for uhttpd. Traditionally 'px5g' based on
    PolarSSL (or mbedTLS in LEDE), has been used for the creation.
    
    uhttpd init script is enhanced by adding detection of an installed
    openssl command-line binary (provided by 'openssl-util' package),
    and if found, the tool is used for certificate generation.
    
    Note: After this patch the script prefers to use the OpenSSL tool
    if both it and px5g are installed.
    
    This enables creating a truly OpenSSL-only version of LuCI
    without dependency to PolarSSL/mbedTLS based px5g.

    openssl: fix wrong build target strings
    
    Signed-off-by: Jo-Philipp Wich <jo@mein.io>

commit 25b34dd97fcb36350ac515469001e7c489521718
Author: Jo-Philipp Wich <jow@openwrt.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 1 14:31:08 2016 +0000

    openssl: update to 1.0.2g (8 CVEs)
    
    CVE-2016-0704
    
    s2_srvr.c overwrite the wrong bytes in the master-key when applying
    Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites. This provides a
    Bleichenbacher oracle, and could potentially allow more efficient variants of
    the DROWN attack.
    
    CVE-2016-0703
    
    s2_srvr.c did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers.
    If clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key
    bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if
    an eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as
    an oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the
    server and negligible computation. More importantly, this leads to a more
    efficient version of DROWN that is effective against non-export ciphersuites,
    and requires no significant computation.
    
    CVE-2016-0702
    
    A side-channel attack was found which makes use of cache-bank conflicts on
    the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture which could lead to the recovery of
    RSA keys. The ability to exploit this issue is limited as it relies on an
    attacker who has control of code in a thread running on the same hyper-
    threaded core as the victim thread which is performing decryptions.
    
    CVE-2016-0799
    
    The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a "%s" format string in
    the BIO_*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a
    string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings. Additionally
    the internal |doapr_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB memory
    location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory
    allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size
    of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT_MAX. E.g. this could be in
    processing a very long "%s" format string. Memory leaks can also occur.
    The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour.
    These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
    passed to the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions in
    this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions
    when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications
    that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources.
    OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out
    ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is
    not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc received via
    remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to trigger these
    issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.
    
    CVE-2016-0797
    
    In the BN_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int
    value |i|. Later |bn_expand| is called with a value of |i * 4|. For large
    values of |i| this can result in |bn_expand| not allocating any memory because
    |i * 4| is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL
    leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the
    calculation |i * 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this case
    memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently
    sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN_dec2bn. This
    could have security consequences if BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn is ever called by user
    applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be
    a rare occurrence. All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that
    is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command
    line arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based
    on untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security
    consequences. This is also anticipated to be rare.
    
    CVE-2016-0798
    
    The SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user had confusing memory
    management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly allocated, and
    sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of distinguishing
    these two cases. Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide
    valid login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker connecting
    with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around 300 bytes per
    connection. Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do not
    configure a seed are not vulnerable. In Apache, the seed directive is known as
    SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed. To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in
    SRP_VBASE_get_by_user is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed.
    Applications are advised to migrate to SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user. However, note
    that OpenSSL makes no strong guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid
    and invalid logins. In particular, computations are currently not carried out
    in constant time.
    
    CVE-2016-0705
    
    A double free bug was discovered when OpenSSL parses malformed DSA private keys
    and could lead to a DoS attack or memory corruption for applications that
    receive DSA private keys from untrusted sources. This scenario is considered
    rare.
    
    CVE-2016-0800
    
    A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS
    sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a
    Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between clients and non-
    vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting SSLv2
    and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP)
    shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is known
    as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800). Recovering one session key requires the attacker to
    perform approximately 2^50 computation, as well as thousands of connections to
    the affected server. A more efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists
    against unpatched OpenSSL servers using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m,
    1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on 19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below). Users can
    avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS servers,
    if they've not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also sufficient,
    provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and 1.0.2f)
    have been deployed. Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol, and are
    not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2
    ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of
    SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers. OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following
    mitigation against DROWN: SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time.
    Builds that are not configured with "enable-ssl2" will not support SSLv2.
    Even if "enable-ssl2" is used, users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the
    version-flexible SSLv23_method() will need to explicitly call either of:
    SSL_CTX_clear_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2); or SSL_clear_options(ssl,
    SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2); as appropriate. Even if either of those is used, or the
    application explicitly uses the version-specific SSLv2_method() or its client
    or server variants, SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery
    have been removed. Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2
    56-bit DES are no longer available. In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up
    are now disabled in default builds of OpenSSL. Builds that are not configured
    with "enable-weak-ssl-ciphers" will not provide any "EXPORT" or "LOW" strength
    ciphers.

    OpenSSL: Added source/old to PKG_SOURCE_URL
    
    OpenSSL moves old versions of the library from
    http://www.openssl.org/source/ to
    http://www.openssl.org/source/old/$version/ breaking the old links.
    That behavior breaks the OpenWRT-build every time OpenSSL releases
    a new version.
    
    This patch adds http://www.openssl.org/source/old/$version/ to the
    PKG_SOURCE_URL of OpenSSL to avoid breaking the build whenever
    OpenSSL releases a new version.

    openssl: update to v1.0.2d (CVE-2015-1793)
    
    During certificate verification, OpenSSL (starting from version 1.0.1n and
    1.0.2b) will attempt to find an alternative certificate chain if the first
    attempt to build such a chain fails. An error in the implementation of this
    logic can mean that an attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted
    certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a valid
    leaf certificate to act as a CA and "issue" an invalid certificate.
    
    This issue will impact any application that verifies certificates including
    SSL/TLS/DTLS clients and SSL/TLS/DTLS servers using client authentication.

    6in4: detect curl and busybox wget
    
    b52053b 6in4: https support for he.net tunnel api
    introduced HTTPS support using wget.
    The busybox version of wget, however, doesn't support the -V option,
    thus poluting logfiles with a full invalid-parameter-output.
    Redirect stderr to fix that.
    As libcurl and curl support selecting the SSL library of your choice,
    also add support for curl which is more commonly used on OpenWrt than
    "real" wget which needs libopenssl.
    Also make sure to respect SSL_CERT_DIR and increase timeouts.

    openssl: add support for RIPEMD/160
    
    RIPEMD is needed to update erlang and i'd like to enable RIPEMD160 support in openssh.
    
    Size compared:
    
    openssl without RIPEMD/160 support:
    647K 29. Okt 20:00 bin/ar71xx/packages/libopenssl_1.0.1e-2_ar71xx.ipk
    
    openssl with RIPEMD/160 support:
    652K  8. Nov 15:11 bin/ar71xx/packages/libopenssl_1.0.1e-2_ar71xx.ipk
    
    So the file size just grows ~5kb, which shouldn't be a problem.

    I've excluded the sample conf file as it's useless when used with mac80211.sh (Emanuel Taube patch)
    It now link against libnl-tiny instead of libnl (patch merged in authsae git)

    openssl: use asm SHA1, SHA256, AES on MIPS.
    
    On a lightly loaded 24Kc, as measured by 'openssl speed sha1', shows between
    27% and 120% speedup depending on block size.
    SHA1 is notably used in Transmission for piece verification.

    openssl does not compile with uml and arch x86_64
    
    Hi,
    
    I found that openssl did not compile on the uml target under x86_64. The
    attached patch should
    correct this and is working for me. Is this the right way to do it?
    
    thanks,
    Thomas

commit 8f16983e89e3c0095de7bdd902e88cc5d5830979
Author: Felix Fietkau <nbd@openwrt.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 28 21:09:44 2007 +0000

    Add a patch for openssl to fix some breakage that happens when compiled with gcc 4.2.0 Note: this does not cover all instances, but it will at least compile.
    
    If the broken parts are reached at run time, the program will crash.
    I wonder whose stupid idea it was to intentionally(!) make programs segfault when they hit something that *might* be unsafe to use.
    
    Patch taken from http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-dev@openssl.org/msg22667.html
